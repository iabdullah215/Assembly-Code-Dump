; We already know that SHL performs unsigned multiplication efficiently when the multiplier is a power of 2.
;  • You can factor any binary number into powers of 2.
;  • For example, to multiply EAX * 36,
;  • factor 36 into 32 + 4 and
;  • use the distributive property of multiplication to carry out the operation.
